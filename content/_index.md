We are a group of Orthodox Christians who live in the Toowoomba and Darling Downs region. Regularly worshipping together at Vespers on Saturdays at 7pm and **the Divine Liturgy on Sundays from 9am at [5 Fletcher St, Redwood.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GB67qwagc1JGQrEU6)**

All people of good will are welcome to our services. If you are an Orthodox Christian, or if you want to find out more about how original Christianity is practiced today, we welcome you to join us.
