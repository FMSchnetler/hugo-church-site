January typically sees additional services in celebration of the Nativity of Christ, including the Divine Liturgy on 7 January. We also celebrate our Parish Feastday on the weekend following Theophany (19 January).
Around Easter, we typically hold services for Good Friday (Royal Hours and the Vespers of the Shroud) and for the Resurrection of Christ, on Pascha.
