If you have the means please consider donating financially to our mission so we can continue to grow and cover ongoing costs. This will be especially useful as we renovate and furnish our new Cambooya location. For regular parishioners we recommend setting a scheduled deposit. We also accept cash given in person. We are grateful for any donations no matter how great or how small.
