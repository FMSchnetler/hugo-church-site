### What to Expect

- Our services are longer than some may expect that have a background in other denominations, Vespers is usually just over 1 hour in length and the Divine Liturgy around 2 hours.
- We do not have pews, though newcomers are welcome to use the available seating.
- Our services are performed acapella, without any accompanying instruments, in a liturgical responsary style.
- It is customary, but not mandatory, for men to wear long sleeve button up shirts and trousers and for women to wear headscarves and maxi dresses or ankle length skirts.

If it's your first time coming please stay for tea so we can get to know you and answer any question you may have.
