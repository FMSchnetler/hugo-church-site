### Our Congregation Today

We are an Orthodox Christian congregation living the ancient, biblical faith of the New Testament Church; a part of the same Church that was founded by Christ, preached by His apostles, and carried on by their successors, through the centuries, to us today.

At present, we are the only Orthodox church on the Darling Downs. Currently, around 20 people are generally in attendance when we celebrate the Divine Liturgy, creating a welcoming and inviting atmosphere. We welcome all people of good will to our services â€“ both those Orthodox Christians who live in Toowoomba and the Darling Downs, and those who want to find out more about how original Christianity is practiced today.

### Our Clergy and our Diocese

Resident in Toowoomba, our Parish Priest is Fr. Erich Fein [link], who leads our community through celebrating sacraments & services, providing pastoral care, teaching the faithful, and otherwise administering the Mission.
You can contact Fr. Erich by e-mail: toowoomba@holyannunciation.net

Our Mission is within the Northern Deanery of the Diocese of Australia and New Zealand (ROCOR) [link], headed by Archbishop George (Schaefer) of Sydney, Australia & New Zealand [link].

### Our Patron Saint

Our Mission is dedicated to the Forerunner of Christ, St John the Baptist. We celebrate this feastday in January, recalling his role in the Baptism of Jesus Christ.
