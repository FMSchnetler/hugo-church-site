### Our Congregation Today

We are an Orthodox Christian congregation living the ancient, biblical faith of the New Testament Church; a part of the same Church that was founded by Christ, preached by His apostles, and carried on by their successors, through the centuries, to us today.

At present, we are the only Orthodox church in the Darling Downs region, with around 20 people in attendance when we celebrate the Divine Liturgy.

<!-- #### What to expect at our services

- Our services are longer than some may expect that have a background in other denominations, Vespers is usually just over 1 hour in length and the Divine Liturgy around 2 hours.
- We do not have pews, though newcomers are welcome to use the available seating.
- Our services are performed acapella, without any accompanying instruments, in a liturgical responsary style.
- It is customary, but not mandatory, for men to wear long sleeve button up shirts and trousers and for women to wear headscarves and maxi dresses or ankle length skirts.

All of that aside, we will not be carefully looking at anyone for how they act, but instead focussing on our own spiritual state. -->

If it's your first time coming please stay for tea so we can get to know you and answer any questions you may have.

### Our Patron Saint

Our Mission is dedicated to the Glorious Forerunner of Christ, St. John the Baptist, under whom Christ himself deigned to be baptised in the Jordan. We celebrate our patronal feast on his [Nativity](https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2019/06/homily-on-nativity-of-saint-john.html) in July.

Here are some edifying words from St. Theophan the Recluse on St. John:
> Saint John bore witness of Christ Jesus, that He is in truth "the Lamb of God, Which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29), that He is the promised Deliverer, awaited by all. Those who were near him heard this and believed. From them this witness passed on to the people, and everyone began to think that he of whom John bore witness was not an ordinary man. The Savior pointed this out when in the last days in the temple, he proposed to the heads of the temple a question: whence was the baptism of John, from heaven or of men? (cf. Mark 11:29) They refrained from answering, because it was impossible for them not to see that John came baptizing with water not of himself. But if they were to say this, they would immediately have to acknowledge John's testimony that the Promised One was before them, and therefore be compelled to submit to His teaching. But they did not want to submit, not for any well-founded reasons, but solely because of their prejudice. But their obstinacy does not in the least lessen the power of the witness of St. John. To this day, it is as certain as it was when it came forth from his mouth. We hearken unto John who shows us the true Deliverer; and through this we enliven our faith, as a faith which has tangible proof behind it.

May St. John pray to God for us.
